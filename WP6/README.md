# Work package 6

The WP6 was about data quality and the development of a R library containing the basic structure of a RDB and the main methods to handle the data. The library was named CLEFRDB standing for Core Library for Ecosystem and Fisheries data in the RDB.

The CLEFRDB R package is dedicated to facilitate data handling, based on the construction of fishery-dependent data container objects, with an embedded quality check. The mechanism to build up such containers is generic in order to accommodate any data structure for the entry data and facilitate the provision as an output to an RDB or as an answer to fishery-dependent data calls, with the aim of tackling the issue of providing the same information in different formats to different end-users. The construction ensures intrinsically the quality of the data these objects contain.

A video of presentation of the library and the conclusions of a possible follow-up is available here:
